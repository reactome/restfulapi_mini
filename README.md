# restfulapi_mini

To support Java 11, tomcat 9 and Spring boot, [the minimal version of the Reactome RESTful API](https://github.com/reactome/RESTfulAPI/tree/minimized) has been re-implemented. There are only three methods supported in this version. This version is used to provide biopax export for the Reactome production server. 

For all other functions that have been used at curator.reactome.org, see the original codebase: [https://github.com/reactome/RESTfulAPI](https://github.com/reactome/RESTfulAPI).
